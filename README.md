This is a modified version of https://github.com/eriedaberrie/texera that is able to dynamically start and stop a docker compose Texera instance through the flask application called "compose_script.py", and serves as a core backend functionality to the wordpress-data-analysis-sharing website.                                                      Prerequisites to running the flask application successfully includes running "docker-compose up --build" to build Texera containers in core/docker, pip installing flask and docker and docker compose
